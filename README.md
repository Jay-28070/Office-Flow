# officeFlow

**officeFlow** is a web-based application that automates internal service requests and task management within a company. Employees can submit IT, HR, or maintenance requests, track their status, and view leave balances. Admins manage department-specific requests, assign tasks to staff, and review staff profiles. Super Admins can create and assign admin accounts, including department heads, ensuring secure role-based access.

Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express**, and **Firebase** for authentication and cloud data storage.

##  Firebase Authentication Integrated!

This project now uses **Firebase Authentication** for secure user management:

-  **Password Encryption**: Automatic bcrypt hashing by Firebase
-  **User Storage**: Cloud-based Firestore database
-  **Login/Sessions**: Firebase Authentication with secure tokens
-  **Security Tokens**: JWT tokens signed by Google
-  **Password Reset**: Built-in password recovery
-  **Cloud Backup**: Automatic data backup and scaling

   - Update `frontend/users/scripts/firebase-config.js` with your Firebase config

3. **Start server**
```bash
node app.js
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Migration from Local Storage

If you have existing data in `backend/db/database.json`, you can migrate it to Firestore:

```bash
cd backend
node utils/migrateToFirestore.js
```

**Note**: Migrated users will need to reset their passwords using the "Forgot Password" feature.
